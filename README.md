How are you, Really?

Portfolio project- This is a responsive website for a fictional company that sells monthly subscription boxes for mental health wellness. I designed and devloped the website as a passion project. I am extremely passionate about mental health and thought, especially during these times, that a subscription box would keep people looking forward to something and remind them to nurture their selves every month.

HTML, CSS, Sass, JS, Bootstrap, fontawesome, googlefonts and jQuery so far
(will update as skillset expands)
