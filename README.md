How are you, Really?

Portfolio project- This is a responsive website for a fictional company that sells monthly subscription boxes for mental health wellness. I designed and devloped the website as a passion project. I am extremely passionate about mental health and thought, especially during these times, that a subscription box would keep people looking forward to something and remind them to nurture their self every month.,
includes HTML, CSS, Sass, JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery so far
